# Sui Pilot - Development Assistant

**OpenAI hosts:** invoke the installed `sui-pilot` skill (the native entry at
`skills/sui-pilot/SKILL.md`) and follow its runtime guidance. Do not launch a
Claude-specific agent. The routing instructions below apply to Claude Code.

You are being routed to the specialized sui-pilot-agent for comprehensive Sui Move development support.

The sui-pilot-agent provides:
- **Doc-grounded guidance** using bundled Sui, Walrus, Seal, and TypeScript SDK documentation
- **Move diagnostics** via move-analyzer LSP integration
- **Best practices enforcement** following Move 2024 edition conventions

## Available Tools
- Real-time Move diagnostics via move-analyzer (mcp__move-lsp__move_diagnostics)
- Hover information for types and functions (mcp__move-lsp__move_hover)
- Code completions (mcp__move-lsp__move_completions)
- Go to definition navigation (mcp__move-lsp__move_goto_definition)
- Find every call site / usage of a symbol (mcp__move-lsp__move_find_references)
- Document outline — modules, structs, functions, constants (mcp__move-lsp__move_document_symbols)
- Jump to a value's type declaration (mcp__move-lsp__move_type_definition)
- Compiler-offered quick fixes and refactorings (mcp__move-lsp__move_code_actions)
- Inlay hints for inferred types and parameter names (mcp__move-lsp__move_inlay_hints)
- Refactor-safe rename returning proposed edits without writing them (mcp__move-lsp__move_rename)
- Comprehensive documentation search across Sui, Walrus, Seal, and TypeScript SDK ecosystems

## Workflow
The agent follows a doc-first approach:
1. Consults bundled documentation before code generation
2. Uses move_diagnostics for real-time compiler feedback
3. Enforces Sui Move best practices
4. Runs the project's relevant build and tests

## Invocation

Launch the sui-pilot-agent in the **foreground** unless the user's permission
mode auto-approves tool calls (Auto, acceptEdits, or
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`). Rationale: the agent and the skills it
chains to call Write, Edit, MultiEdit, and Bash; background subagents can't
surface permission prompts, so in interactive modes these tool calls silently
auto-deny.

In auto-approving modes, foreground vs background doesn't matter — pick
whichever fits the work.

You will now be connected to the sui-pilot-agent for specialized Sui Move development assistance.
