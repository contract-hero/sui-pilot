## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **v2-minimal: rolled back the borrowed matcher pipeline after eval parity.** The `feat/v2-graph-port` branch adopted a skill-injection architecture from Vercel's own Claude Code plugin (slim preamble + ecosystem graph + hooks pipeline + manifest + doctor) — a defensible bet on a well-engineered pattern, used by a serious team. The eval suite then showed the pattern doesn't transfer to sui-pilot's shape: the 2026-04-30 baseline produced functional parity with main (13/13 after adjudication), and the 2026-05-11 re-run after the rollback produced identical-output parity (14/14 literal). The matcher solves prompt-disambiguation for plugins with many competing skills; sui-pilot ships 5 explicitly-invokable slash skills, so the disambiguation problem doesn't exist here. Removed: entire `hooks/` tree (src + compiled `.mjs` + tsup config + tests), `sui.md` ecosystem graph, `sui-session.md`, `generated/skill-manifest.json`, `scripts/build-manifest.ts`, `scripts/doctor.ts`, `scripts/verify.sh`, `commands/sui-pilot-doctor.md`, `CONTEXT_INJECTION.md`, `DESIGN_V2.md`, `RESEARCH_NOTES.md`, `hooks/test/README.md`, and the matcher `metadata:` frontmatter from all 5 `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Kept: slim `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md` preamble (~2.9 KB always-loaded via `@`-import), 5 slash skills (bodies untouched), bundled doc corpora, MCP `move-lsp`, eval suite. ~17 K LOC net deletion across 57+ files. Rationale: `NOTES.md`. Empirical evidence: `evals/BASELINE.md`.
- **Eval harness added** at `evals/run-comparison.sh` + `evals/tasks.json` + `evals/fixtures/`. Started as a 15-task A/B suite (Move 2024 syntax migrations, OTW, dynamic-object fields, transfer policies, randomness, Walrus, Seal, SDK 2.0) and grew to 27 tasks across 5 categories: tier-1 (15), multi-file refactors (4), ambiguous specs with LLM-rubric grading (3), stale-training traps (4), token-pressure prompts (1). Harness features: 2-way v1/v2 comparison, per-task token capture (`tokens.csv`), optional `sui move build` compile gate, self-contained HTML scorer output, rubric grading. The suite was load-bearing twice: it caught the over-injection regression in the precut v2 run and justified the cut empirically; the post-cut + Tier-2 runs confirmed the slim shape is parity (no quality regression, ~10% more expensive on the public Anthropic rate card). Designed to be a foundation for evaluating any Sui-related Claude Code skill — see `NOTES.md` §5 for the design narrative and how to extend it.
- **`NOTES.md` added** as the single canonical in-repo narrative — origin story, what we tried adopting from a sibling plugin, what the evals showed, what survived, and the eval framework as a foundation for future Sui-skill evaluation. Companion to `evals/BASELINE.md` (raw data), `evals/README.md` (operator manual), and `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- **`EVAL_FRAMEWORK.html` added** at the repo root as a self-contained, shareable explainer of the entire eval methodology and findings. Designed to be opened in a browser by anyone wanting to understand how to measure context strategies for Sui Move development, without cloning the repo. Inline CSS, inline SVG diagram of the eval pipeline, no external assets.

- **BREAKING: install path moved to `contract-hero/plugin-marketplace`.** sui-pilot is now distributed via the multi-plugin Contract Hero marketplace at [contract-hero/plugin-marketplace](https://github.com/contract-hero/plugin-marketplace) instead of from a self-hosted single-plugin marketplace at the repo root. The README install block, "Migrating from the old `alilloig/sui-pilot` marketplace" section, and troubleshooting commands now reference `sui-pilot@contract-hero`. Existing users on the `alilloig/sui-pilot` marketplace must run `/plugin uninstall sui-pilot@alilloig`, `/plugin marketplace remove alilloig`, then `/plugin marketplace add contract-hero/plugin-marketplace`, then `/plugin install sui-pilot@contract-hero`.
- **Move Book is now indexed as a fifth doc corpus.** [`MystenLabs/move-book`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/move-book) (the canonical Move-language tutorial + language reference) is pulled into `.move-book-docs/` alongside the existing `.sui-docs/`, `.walrus-docs/`, `.seal-docs/`, and `.ts-sdk-docs/`. The new `[Move Book Docs Index]` section appears between Sui and Seal in `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md`, giving subagents direct routing for Move language questions (syntax, types, abilities, idioms) instead of forcing them through Sui-specific docs. Total bundled doc files: ~695 (was 548). New `sync_repo_multi` helper in `sync-docs.sh` handles repos with multiple upstream subtrees in a single tarball fetch; `generate_index()` in `generate-docs-index.sh` accepts an optional `skip_subdir` argument to exclude `.move-book-docs/packages/` (Move source examples referenced via `file=` directives — co-located on disk for follow-up reads but kept out of the searchable index). `scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh`, `scripts/verify.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/refresh-docs.yml`, README, CLAUDE, six skill files, and the non-compliant fixture all extended to enumerate the fifth corpus. CLAUDE's routing table heading reframed from "Ecosystem" since Move Book is a language reference, not a protocol layer.
- **`skills/move-pr-review/SKILL.md`** — fallback error message updated to reference `sui-pilot@contract-hero` and `extraKnownMarketplaces["contract-hero"] → contract-hero/plugin-marketplace` instead of the deprecated `alilloig`/`sui-pilot@alilloig` entries.
- **`scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh`** — `pluginVersion` for the docs `VERSION.json` is now read from `mcp/move-lsp-mcp/package.json#version` (the canonical MCP server bundle version, also returned by `mcp/move-lsp-mcp/src/version.ts#getServerVersion`), not from the deleted `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This decouples MCP-server version compatibility from the (now-absent) marketplace-entry version pinning.
- **`scripts/verify.sh`** and **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — dropped the `marketplace.json exists` check now that the file is gone.
- **Doc index relocated into the agent prompt.** The pipe-delimited documentation index (previously at `/AGENTS.md`) now lives inside `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md`, between `<!-- AGENTS-MD-START -->` and `<!-- AGENTS-MD-END -->` markers. Because the agent's system prompt is auto-loaded when the agent is invoked, docs-first guidance now works with zero setup for plugin consumers — no `@AGENTS.md` import in a user CLAUDE.md is required. `generate-docs-index.sh` was rewritten to rewrite only the block between the markers, preserving frontmatter and prose.
- **`/CLAUDE.md` dropped the `@AGENTS.md` import** and the Usage section now points to the embedded index in the agent file.
- **`scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh`** now copies `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md` (the new canonical index home) and `.ts-sdk-docs/` into the `docs/` bundle; `AGENTS.md` is no longer required.
- **`scripts/verify.sh`** now verifies `.ts-sdk-docs/` and checks the agent file for the index markers + four ecosystem section headers instead of the old root `AGENTS.md` existence check.
- **CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)** replaced the `AGENTS.md` existence check with a markered-index + four-ecosystem-header check, and adds a drift-gate that runs `./generate-docs-index.sh` and fails on any diff against the committed agent file.

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/refresh-docs.yml`** — scheduled weekly (Mon 06:00 UTC) + `workflow_dispatch` workflow that runs `sync-docs.sh` → `generate-docs-index.sh` → `scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh` and opens a `chore(docs): refresh upstream docs` PR via `peter-evans/create-pull-request` when the bundled docs drift from upstream.
- **`/move-pr-review` skill** — multi-agent deep PR review for Sui Move packages. Orchestrates 10 parallel `sui-pilot:sui-pilot-agent` reviewers + 1 consolidator from the main Claude Code session. Each reviewer independently invokes `/move-code-review` and `/move-code-quality`, cross-checks integration boundaries against upstream Move deps, and emits strict-schema JSON findings. The consolidator clusters, verifies high-severity claims against source code, and writes an evidence-backed Markdown review with `## Test & coverage plan` and `## Build reproducibility & ops` sections kept separate from the code-level severity body.
- **`commands/move-pr-review.md`** — slash-command routing for the new skill.
- **`skills/move-pr-review/scripts/`** — Node.js + bash + jq utilities: `consolidate.js` (cluster by file + line-range + title similarity), `validate_schema.sh` (per-reviewer strict schema check), `coverage_matrix.sh` (file × reviewer coverage with < 50% floor for leader backfill).
- **`skills/move-pr-review/evals/`** — complete skill-creation walkthrough including iter-1 artifacts (simulated 5 reviewers; surfaced the main-session-orchestration and plugin-registration blockers), iter-2 artifacts (real 10 reviewers; 9/9 assertions pass; 2 HIGH code findings), and a didactic README explaining the full evaluation loop for anyone writing or iterating on a multi-agent skill.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK ecosystem was systemically under-referenced** across user-facing surfaces even though the core pipelines already handled it. The following files now enumerate all four ecosystems (Sui, Walrus, Seal, TS SDK) consistently: `llms.txt`, `commands/sui-pilot.md`, `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md` (Doc-First Rule body), `skills/move-code-quality/SKILL.md`, `skills/move-code-review/SKILL.md`, `skills/move-tests/SKILL.md`, `scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh`, `scripts/verify.sh`, `skills/move-pr-review/references/reviewer_prompt.md`, and the two `.claude-plugin/fixtures/*-workflow-transcript.md` files.
- **`scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh` VERSION.json schema aligned with the MCP server.** The script previously wrote `{sourceCommit, syncTimestamp, suiFrameworkVersion}`, but `mcp/move-lsp-mcp/src/version.ts` expects `{pluginVersion, suiPilotRevision, syncTimestamp}`. With the refresh workflow about to run this script on a schedule, the two had to agree — the script now emits the schema the MCP version check consumes, deriving `pluginVersion` from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `suiPilotRevision` from the short git SHA.
- **`docs/` bundle is now properly gitignored** (only `docs/VERSION.json` stays tracked). The refresh workflow regenerates the bundle on demand; local runs of `scripts/sync-sui-pilot-docs.sh` no longer pollute `git status`.

### Removed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — the self-hosted single-plugin marketplace catalog has been removed. sui-pilot is now a plain plugin repo; the marketplace concern lives entirely in `contract-hero/plugin-marketplace`. With this file gone, every commit on `main` becomes a fresh version for marketplace users (no more `version: "0.1.0"` pinning at the marketplace-entry level).
- **Root `/AGENTS.md`.** External AI consumers that previously read this file should now read `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md`; the same pipe-delimited index is embedded there between the `AGENTS-MD-START` / `AGENTS-MD-END` markers. README's "For Other AI Agents" section was updated to reflect this.

### Notes

- The `/move-pr-review` skill MUST be invoked from the main Claude Code session. Spawned subagents lack the `Task` tool and can't dispatch the 11 sub-subagents this skill depends on; the skill halts with a clear message if `Task` is unavailable.
- First real end-to-end run is captured in `skills/move-pr-review/evals/iteration-2/`: 292 raw findings → 64 clusters → 2 HIGH / 7 MEDIUM / 13 LOW / 8 INFO / 4 rejected, ~26 min wall clock, ~1.45M tokens across all 11 agents.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

First marketplace-installable release. Install via:

```
/plugin marketplace add alilloig/sui-pilot
/plugin install sui-pilot@alilloig
```

### Added

- Self-hosted plugin marketplace at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`alilloig` marketplace, one plugin `sui-pilot` sourced from the repo root).
- Prebundled `move-lsp` MCP server (esbuild, minified ESM, ~470 KB) committed at `mcp/move-lsp-mcp/dist/index.js` so marketplace installs work with no post-install build step.
- Bundled documentation for the Sui, Walrus, Seal, and TypeScript SDK ecosystems (548 files total).
- Five slash commands: `/sui-pilot`, `/move-code-quality`, `/move-code-review`, `/move-tests`, `/oz-math`.
- `sui-pilot-agent` doc-first subagent.
- CI drift-check and bundle-size budget (600 KB ceiling) on the committed MCP bundle.

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` no longer declares `commands`/`skills`/`agents` explicitly — relies on Claude Code auto-discovery from the standard `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` directories at the plugin root.
- Installation instructions rewritten around the marketplace flow; Node.js and pnpm are no longer end-user prerequisites.

### Removed

- `scripts/setup.sh` — superseded by the prebundled marketplace install.
- Root-level `.mcp.json` — redundant with `plugin.json`'s `mcpServers` declaration.

### Supersedes

- [#8](https://github.com/alilloig/sui-pilot/pull/8) by @nikos-terzo — same structural direction (auto-discovery + marketplace manifest), but this release additionally fixes the `dist/`-is-gitignored bug, removes the duplicate `.mcp.json`, uses `alilloig`-owned metadata, and moves the plugin version onto the marketplace entry per docs guidance for relative-path plugins.
